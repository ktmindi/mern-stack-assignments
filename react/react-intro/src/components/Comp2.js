//es7+ react/redux extension is really cool because when we go to make a new component 
//type in  rafce and hit TAB it will build the component for me 

import React from 'react' //as of version 18 if we are using version 18 we dont have to add this line of code

const Comp2 = () => {
    return (
    <div>
        <h1>Component 2</h1>
        <button>Click here</button>
    </div>
    )
}

export default Comp2



// so we can choose where we will render this component and in this example we will render it into our component.js file
